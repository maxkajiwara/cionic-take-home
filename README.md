# Cionic Web UI Homework

### [Instructions and Layouts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d0upM8NlhQ3LbN5I2EnSRLmNYtwTYTKnRRhRIHHnwqo)

## About

### This is a [react nextjs app](https://nextjs.org/) written in [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and using [twin.macro](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twin.macro) for styling

The form page is located at `pages/index.tsx`. Global styles can be found at `styles/GlobalStyles.tsx` and custom theme settings can be found in `tailwind.config.js`. A mock API endpoint is set up in `pages/api/form.ts`. The `eslint` and `prettier` files in the root directory are just there for linting and auto-formatting.

## Project Setup

Install the dependencies, build the app, and start the server with your choice of yarn or npm

```
yarn install
yarn build
yarn start
```

```
npm install
npm build
npm start
```

If everything goes smoothly the app should be up and running on http://localhost:3000

## App Behavior

The color and leg options should behave as expected.

The size fields have built-in validation for numeral values with up to two decimal places and no letters or special characters. If an input is out of the range of 0-50, an error message will display and attempting to submit the form will prompt the user to update the value.

Submitting the form will cause the app to enter a "fetching" state, disabling further input until the api returns a response.

If a 200 response is received, a success state is displayed which can be dismissed with a button press.

If you wish to see a non-200 response state, enter `4.00` into either of the size inputs and submit the form.

## Accessibility

Hidden under the color & leg styling is a radio button for each type; this accomplishes two goals: 1. Enable keyboard navigation; 2. Allow screen readers to understand the layout for accessibility purposes.

### This form is fully keyboard-navigable:

- Use `tab` & `shift+tab` to navigate between each option

- Use the arrow keys to select either color or leg type

- Use number keys & `.` for size inputs plus up & down arrow keys to increment or decrement the value by 1
